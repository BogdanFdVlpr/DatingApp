# Run project

Let's go to API folder with `cd API` and check that our terminal show us, that we are on this folder, so then we can write `dotnet watch` -> Enter, so we start our backend server.

Next go to our project client folder and run `ng serve` for a dev server. 

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
